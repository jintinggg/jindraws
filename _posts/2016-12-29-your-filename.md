## A new drawing space

My new blog is finally up right here, and I’m really excited to upload more drawings and doodles onto this blog. My old wordpress jiinome.wordpress.com, I felt, was limiting in the sense that I can't upload things the way I want or design the blog the way I want. This holiday break has been a period of “creative theraphy” where I started to pick up a pencil to draw again. The last time I had done that was probably around 3 or 4 years ago, and since then I have already forgotten the joy of sitting with my back crouched for an hour or two and coming up with a drawing/doodle as a result of immense concentration. I have never been a “words” kind of person, so my drawings/doodles often express the images that pop into my little mind from time to time.

Here’s to more doodles/drawings/illustrating/and whatever creative poodles!
