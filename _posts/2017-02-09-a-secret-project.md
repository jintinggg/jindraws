Around two weeks ago, I was thinking about what I should give to Seb since our first anniversary was approaching. I was (and am) still have my 2016 mini desk calendar on my table since I couldn't find a cheap + small + aesthetically pleasing 2017 calendar yet. Anyway, since I have wanted to learn to make new things on Illustrator and Seb did not a desk calendar, the desk calendar/ first anniversary present was conceived. I knew that I wanted to chart our relationship milestones using flat design characters, so I googled a lot about flat design characters and learnt from some really helpful youtube tutorial channels like @Gigantic. The whole process was really enjoyable and unlike my previous concerns, it did not stress me out much at all because I managed to plan out what "character scenarios" each monthly frame should capture and was constantly thinking of ways to make the characters seem more animated and less block-like. I sourced for a mountboard at Art Friend for the calendar holder. Finally, I got the frames printed at CLB for around $9-10. It could be a lot cheaper but I took a while to experiment manually choosing the colours. I think the best colour setting for graphics printing on normal A4 papers would be:

Neutral Grays: 4-colour (on some frames I selected 'Black', but that means that pictures with different shades of grey would automatically be replaced with Black. Pretty bad)
Halftone: Smooth
RGB Color: Vivid

And so I surprised Seb!

This is how it looks like on screen:
